## Machine Learning Assignments CS6140

These are the 5 assignments that I completed in CS6140 under Prof. Sarala Arunagiri. The problem statement of each assignment is given in the root directory of the repo.

Here's a list of topics that are covered in each assignment.

1. Classification with Numerical and Categorical Features ( Decision Trees and Regression Trees) 
2. Linear Regression with Gradient Descent, Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression
3. Logistic Regression, Multi Document Classification
4. Single and Dual Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Finding Model Hyper-Parameters
5. k-means Clustering and Gausian Mixture Model

The solutions of each of the assignments are submodules which are private (which means if you click on them, you'll get a 404)
